# 2450Project McGUI

Group Members: Angie Kim, Joseph Wageni, Max Lau, Henry Tran, Hung Nguyen

About the Project:   
A fast food cashier GUI that will take customer orders. The GUI is split in half where the left side will have three tabs (Food, Drink, Payment). Each tab will have buttons that will let the user select the food and drinks the customer wants as well as the type of payment the customer wants to pay with. The right side will display the customer orders, total and subtotal. There are also two buttons one to check out and the other to clear the customer's orders.



GUI Implementation:   
The GUI uses a split pane for the main panel. The left side has a tabbed pane with buttons added in each tab. The food and drink buttons will have photos and names of each food/drink, for selecting a drink size it use radio buttons that allow the user to select small, medium, or large. The payment tab will have radio buttons for credit cards, Venmo, and cash. The right side will have a normal panel that will have labels to display the customer's orders as well as two buttons that will proceed to the checkout and a clear button that will clear the customer's orders setting it back to nothing. 



Running GUI:   
Before Running the program there should be the FinalProject.Java file and FoodImage folders. These should be in the same file location since our programs use images in the FoodImage folder, without the image the program will not run. After compiling and running our program using the GUI will be easy. Simply select the foods or drinks that are ordered and the order will display on the right side of the GUI with the cost. To checkout simply click the checkout button and it will display the total to the user. If the user needs to clear the display they only need to press the clear button which will clear the display.
